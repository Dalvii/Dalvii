## Selected Projects

### [**LiveMate**](https://livemate.app/?utm_source=github)
A social app that connects people going to the same concerts and festivals.  
Built with React Native and Next.js, it integrates Spotify, ticketing, and eco-friendly ridesharing.  
The project includes a matchmaking system, in-app chat, and a dashboard for organizers to engage their audience.

### [**GardenTicket**](https://studiofleuve.com/gardenticket/)
A ticketing platform that lets visitors book access to Europe’s most remarkable gardens.  
Built with AdonisJS, Stripe, and a mobile app for both visitors and garden managers.

### [**mc-web-voicechat**](https://github.com/Dalvii/mc-webcamhead/)
A multiplayer Minecraft **mod** that adds real-time voice chat using your webcam and microphone.  
Players can literally *see and hear* each other’s faces mapped to their in-game skins, powered by WebRTC and Fabric.  
Fun, experimental, and slightly chaotic, just how side projects should be.
